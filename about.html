                The Island
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Taniti currently has 10 restaurants: five serve mostly local fish and rice, three serve American-style meals, and two serve Pan-Asian cuisine. For visitors who prefer to prepare their own meals or grab food on the go, Taniti has two supermarkets, two smaller grocery stores, and one convenience store that is open 24 hours a day.

                Getting Around
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing which is easy to explore on foot.
